Create a `Procfile` file at your application root, to declare the server command:

```
web: node app.js
```

Create a new Heroku application

```
$ heroku create
```

Push your code to heroku:

```
$ git push heroku master
```

Ensure you have at least one node running:

```
$ heroku ps:scale web=1
```
